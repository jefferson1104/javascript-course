# Data Types

#### These are string, number, Boolean, null, undefined, BigInt and symbol.


#### STRINGS and NUMBERS
In JavaScript, text values are known as the string data type while numerical
values are referred to as the number data type. From a programming perspective, 
making a distinction between numbers and text is important because they adhere 
to different rules. For example, to build a number, you simply type in the 
numerical values but to build a string in JavaScript, the characters must be 
enclosed in either single or double quotes.

#### BOOLEAN
The Boolean data type has only two values, true and false. This means that it is
useful for making decisions.

#### BIGINT and SYMBOL
The capabilities of JavaScript have evolved over time and version ES6 introduced 
two new primitive data types to help with more complex tasks. One is the BigInt 
data type which is like an extra large box that can accommodate a much greater 
range of numbers than the number data type. Finally, there is the symbol data 
type which can be used as a unique identifier.
